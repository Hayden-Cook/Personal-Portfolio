            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200" alt="this is where my photo goes">
                <p>I am 26 years old and currently living in Tennessee with my wife, Olivia. We are expecting our first child very soon, and could not be more excited.
                   I currently work in the Forklift sales industry, but decided to join a coding bootcamp because I was ready to do something different. Since graduating UT Chattanooga,
                   I have worked in the service and sales sides of the forklift industry. When I have time to spare, I enjoy playing disc golf, video games, hiking, and going on adventures 
                   with my wife. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and please enjoy!
                </p>
