# Personal-Portfolio

## Description
This application is and will grow to be a culmination of my works. Though it may not seem like much, as the semester continues, and as I have more projects to show, they will be up loaded to this portfolio. A lot of companies that are hiring, require candidates to have a portfolio with multiple applications. I think this assingment will benefit me greatly.
